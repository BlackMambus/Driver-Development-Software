# Driver-Development-Software
​Driver development involves creating software for Windows.
​Driver development involves creating software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices.
While many drivers are traditionally written in C for its efficiency and control.
C++ is also a viable option, offering features like object-oriented programming that can enhance code organization and maintainability. 
However, when developing drivers in C++, it's essential to avoid certain features not supported in kernel-mode programming, such as exceptions, standard input/output operations, and dynamic memory allocation from the heap.
For Windows driver development using C++, the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) provides necessary tools and libraries. 
Integrating the WDK with Microsoft Visual Studio enables developers to write, build, and debug drivers efficiently.
